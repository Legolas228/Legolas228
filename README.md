## 🧭 About

Junior software developer focused on system-level programming, memory management, and problem-solving using C and C++.  
I work with structured logic, debugging discipline, and clean, maintainable code practices.

Previous experience in team coordination and operations makes me reliable in collaborative environments: clear communication, responsibility, and consistent delivery.

Currently expanding backend fundamentals and learning Kotlin.
